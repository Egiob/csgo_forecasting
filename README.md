# CSGO Odds forecasting 

The goal of this project is to build an application that provides an interface for forecasting the outcome of Counter Strige: Global Offensive competitive games.
<<<<<<< HEAD
It includes :
- a theoretical approach of gambling theory in the case of betting on competitve games.
- a way to aggregate different sources available online to build features to predict the outcomes of the matches.
- a model and a decision rule that is supposed to beat a particular bookmaker, only using the latter features.
- some tools and simulations of what can be done in the field of Counter Strike odds prediction.
