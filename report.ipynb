    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict the outcomes of competitive games by using some features available online that gives some information about the probability of a team to win a given match.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "Team 1 encounters Team 2 on a best-of-1 match. A bookmaker provide odds for the Team $i$ to win, in the format $o_i = x$ where $x \\in [1,\\infty[$. Meaning that if one bets $b = 1€$ on Team 1 with odds $o_1 = 2.4$ then he earns:\n",
    " $$G_1 = \\begin{cases} b.o_1-1 = 1.4€ &if\\ Team\\ 1\\ wins \\\\\n",
    " -b = -1€ & otherwise\\end{cases} $$  \n",
    "\n",
    "The odds given by the bookmaker imply the probabilities of teams to win the match. If $o_1 = 2.4$ then the implied probability (for the team 1 to win the game) should be $p_1 = \\frac{1}{2.4} \\approx 42\\% $. In fact, it would be like this if the odds were fair, but they are not, so the bookmaker makes a profit. If the odds were fair (*ie.* $p_1 = 1/o_1$) we would have the following gain expectancy:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{E}[G_1] &= p_1(b.o_1-1)+(1-p_1)(-b) \\\\\n",
    " &= b - p_1 -b + p_1 \\\\\n",
    " &= 0\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "So the odds are set unfair by the bookmaker so that $1/o_1+1/o_2 = 1 + margin >1$.\n",
    "To obtain the implied probability we just have to normalize:\n",
    "$$p_1 =\\frac{\\frac{1}{o_1}}{\\frac{1}{o_1}+\\frac{1}{o_2}},\\ p_2 =\\frac{\\frac{1}{o_2}}{\\frac{1}{o_1}+\\frac{1}{o_2}},\\ p_1+p_2=1$$\n",
    "\n",
    " As a consequence, without further knowledge over the outcome of the match, the gain expectancy will be strictly negative, proportional to the margin of the bookmaker. If people make bet, it is because they think they have an edge over the bookmaker, so they can \"beat the odds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we want\n",
    "Let's denote $\\bar Y \\hookrightarrow Ber(\\bar p_1)$  the true (unknown but observed) output of the match (equal to $1$ if Team 1 wins, and to $0$ if Team 2 wins). We want to estimate $\\hat Y \\hookrightarrow Ber(\\hat p_1)$ with enough precision so we can beat the bookmaker margin.\n",
    "If we know surely $\\hat p_1$ we would have the following expectancy of betting on Team 1:\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{E}[G_1] &= \\hat p_1(b.o_1-1)+(1-\\hat p_1)(-b) \\\\\n",
    " &= b.\\hat p_1o_1 - \\hat p_1 -b + \\hat p_1 \\\\\n",
    " &= b(\\hat p_1o_1-1)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "And a simple betting rule would be :\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned}\\mathbb{E}[G_1] &> 0 \\iff \\hat p_1 > 1/o_1\n",
    "\\end{aligned}$$\n",
    "Similarly we derive the betting rule on Team 2, we bet if $\\hat p_2 > 1/o_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Because of the bookmaker margin both conditions may be false together, thus, sometimes there will be matches where the best solution is simply not to bet at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "To obtain this prediction model we have to calculate some features in order to have an edge over the bookmaker.\n",
    "Which features influences the outcome of the match ?\n",
    "### In theory\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *The ranking of the teams* : basically a kind of power ranking of teams, some are just better than others in every field of the game.\n",
    "2. *The fitness of the teams* : are they on a winning streak, a losing streak ? Did they recently outperformed/underperformed other teams ?\n",
    "3. *The antecedents of the encounter* : if Team 1 never lost to Team 2 in 20 matches, this could be a key information to take into account.\n",
    "4. *The map on which the game is played* : like in Tennis, Nadal is better on clay court while Federer is better on hard.\n",
    "5. *The fitness of the players* : the game is played in teams of five, the performance of the team depends highly of the performance of every single player.\n",
    "6. *The odds given by the bookmaker* : well it does not really *influence* the outcome of the game, but since the bookmakers make small errors, their predictions are relevant and they should be used for predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Information may be hard to find and to aggregate, thus, the only features used up to now are :\n",
    " - The ranking of the teams,\n",
    " - The fitness of the teams,\n",
    " - The antecedents of the encounter,\n",
    " - The odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sources of information are :\n",
    " - The API of pandasport.co\n",
    " - The odds of the bookmaker CSGOLounge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Team rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandasport API provides us a complete historical data recording almost every CSGO competitive game played since 2016. This is th raw data that we will use to compute the rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "NB : We could have choses an existing power ranking made by websites such as HLTV or Gosugamers, but they are including neither every team nor cover a large enough time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A word on elo ranking**\n",
    " - **ELO ranking** is a ranking system, broadly use in many games, including chess. In the ELO rating system, the difference in the ratings between two players (here teams) serves as a predictor of the outcome of a match. In this way we can estimate how much the ouput of the match deviates from the theory, and update the scores accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basically, here, **we set the elo origin of teams at 1400** in 2016, and then we compute their elo variation each week. This way we have a good estimation of how powerful a team at week $T$ is, based on its ELO score at week $T-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We obtain a ranking in this form**\n",
    "![](img/ranking.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is the evolution of the ELO ranting of the team G2 esports.\n",
    " ![](img/g2_elo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Teams fitness\n",
    "\n",
    "This score is based on the 5 most recents matches of a team, it is like an ELO ranking but just with a finite numbers of records in the past. This feature is likely to take into account the fact that teams in winning streak are more likely to perform well than teams in losing streak.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Teams antecedents\n",
    "\n",
    "This score is based on the history of the two teams that are going to get involved together in a competitive match. We use again an ELO-like computation to derive this score.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Details can be found in the feature engineering [notebook](notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds\n",
    "This feature is very important since we can get a lot of information from the (unknown) odds computation of a bookmaker. Here we are using the data from CSGOLounge, what's specific with this odd system is the fact that it is only a crowd-wisdom odd sytem, as there is no prior used by the website. It only depends on the amount already bet on each teams by the gamblers.\n",
